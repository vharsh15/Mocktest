Mock Test 2 - Big Data - PPT - iNeuron

1. Write an SQL query to find the second-highest salary from an "Employees" table.
Answer -- 
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees);


2. Write a MapReduce program to calculate the word count of a given input text file.
Answer -- 
from mrjob.job import MRJob
import re

WORD_RE = re.compile(r"\w+")

class WordCount(MRJob):
  
  def mapper(self, _, line):
    for word in WORD_RE.findall(line):
      yield word.lower(), 1
  
  def reducer(self, word, counts):
    yield word, sum(counts)
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
  WordCount.run()



3. Write a Spark program to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given text file.
Answer -- 
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("WordCount").getOrCreate()

# Read the text file and split it into words
lines = spark.read.text("input.txt").rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.value.split(" "))

# Count the occurrences of each word
word_counts = lines.map(lambda word: (word, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)

# Print the word counts
for word, count in word_counts.collect():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
